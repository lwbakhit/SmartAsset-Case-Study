## Overview and Origin

* Company: **Smart Asset**

* Year of Incorporation: 2011

* Founders: Michael Carvin and Philip Camilleri

* The idea for SmartAsset started because the founders wanted to close the gap between traditional and automated personal finance. The company allows  people to get advice and read about solutions to their personal financial interests, including being matched with a local financial advisor if they need one. Personal finance is a broad subject that covers many topics and SmartAsset is bringing everything together in an easy to navigate online portal. 

* SmartAsset recieved funding over the course of 6 rounds with the first round in August of 2012. The total amount of funding earned is $51,400,000 with 19 investors. 
The rounds of funding are as follows: 

    1. August 14, 2012: **Debt Financing** - _2 investors_ - $900,000
    2. August 30, 2012: **Seed Round**     - _6 investors_ - $1,500,000
    3. March 25, 2014: **Series A**        - _6 investors_ - $5,200,000
    4. March 14, 2016: **Venture Round**                 -   $3,800,000
    5. September 8, 2016: **Series B**     - _7 investors_ - $12,000,000
    6. June 19, 2018: **Series C**         - 8 _investors_ - $28,000,000

## Business Activities:

* SmartAsset is making financial advice more accessible to people who are seeking information that would normally be answered by a Financial Advisor. Whether someone needs help with deciding how much they need for a home purchase or how to better save towards retirement, SmartAsset has the tools necessary to make their decision easier. Their six main categories include home buying, taxes, retirement, banking, credit cards, and investing. They use Automated Personal Finance technology to help accomplish their outlook.

* Their intended customer is anyone from the average person trying to make smart financial decisions all the way up to the sophisticated investor who is researching their next plan. They also target investors who are looking to work with financial advisors/planners in case they need a second opinion with the SmartAdvisor tool. 

    The website traffic the company attracts is roughly 13,514,004 site visits per month and their educational tools/articles reach an audience of around 65,000,000 people per month. This number could be much higher, as their intended market is world wide.

* SmartAsset has one key solution that other Personal Finance companies do not utilize and that is the live connection to Financial Advisors. They utilize their direct engagement with their audience to offer a service that takes the transaction one step further. When a SmartAsset client goes through their Financial Questionaire, the company's employees reach out to them directly via phone to make a personalized referral to a Financial Advisor in their local area. It moves the client from using their resources for a purely research perspective to meeting an advisor that could redefine how they are meeting their goals. By being a company that provides education to its' clients, they are able to connect the investor with an advisor that doesn't work for their firm. 

* SmartAsset has a patent-pending Automated Financial Modeling technology that they use to simulate how an investors decisions will affect them financially. Their site and articles include different financial calculators that their customers use to research and make smart choices. The company even has an in-house editorial team that writes educational articles for their vast audience. Lastly, their SmartAdvisor portal has been a big part of their growth, which is for the people who want professional advice the traditional way.

## Landscape:

* The FinTech domain SmartAsset falls under is _Personal Finance_. 

* The major trends in the Personal Finance domain over the last 5-10 years have been the development of online advising and resources. Companies have spent huge amounts in innovating mobile and online applications to interact with their clients and to get an edge over competitors. Companies with more user-friendly portals/apps have been able to gain clients from around the world that might not have used their services in the past. In today's world, it's all about accessibility and companies that provide the information at the click of a button are coming out on top. Even large banks and financial services companies are innovating in the FinTech space to keep up with startups that are shaking up the industry. The ability for a client to have access to their accounts and the ability to make payments or changes is everything now. 

* Some of the major companies in the _Personal Finance_ domain are: 
    - Acorns
    - Affirm 
    - Chime
    - Credit Karma
    - Tally
    - Upstart

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
SmartAsset has already made a big impact in the way people can access Personal Financial content and plan to make smarter decisions. They provide such a large array of information all linked by their main site, giving investors one place to find all the personal financial education they could ask for. By adding their Live Connections, they opened the doors to providing a direct path to traditional financial advice as well. There is consistent site traffic of more than 13 million visitors a month and they reach an audience of over 65,000,000 people per month between their tools/articles, so it's safe to say they have already impacted many financial decisions.

* The growth metrics used by SmartAsset are both Revenue, Web Traffic, and Audience reached. SmartAsset isn't as large as some of its' competitors, but with its' new technologies recently coming into play this past year, there is room for a jump in growth. They currently have an annual revenue of about $22,100,000, monthly web traffic averaging just over 13 million, and an excess of 65 million audience members. Some of their competitors are much larger in comparison, but their innovative technology is proving to put them on a track towards a successful future in the Personal Finance domanin in the FinTech industry.

## Recommendations

* Based on my research of SmartAsset and the ability they have to reach a wider audience and gain more market share, I would suggest Robo Advisors. Obviously this would mean a large amount of planning and extra funding, but with the direction the financial services industry is heading it could be a game changer for future growth.

* SmartAsset already has the attention of their audience, so instead of selling away the leads to financial advisors, they could become clients of SmartAsset if they were set up in a way to facilitate the relationship. With FinTech shaking up traditional financial services, many investors are flocking to the virtual advising space, which could mean adding a very lucrative additional service for the company. By not trying to take advantage of the advice they give to their audience, it's almost like a Financial Planner doing all the research and then selling the client to another planner for a small fee in comparison to the value the client brings to the planner's book of business.


* The additional service of Robo Advisors would utilize algorithms to generate portfolios for customers and allocate assets using the correct diversification to meet the client's needs. They should aim for their technology to be as effective as "Betterment" or "Wealthfront", who are some of the leading Robo Advisor technologies in the market. By correctly optimizing the technology, the robo advisors can auto rebalance portfolios, give advice as to where investments should be placed, and follow the client's risk tolerance to accurately deign a strategy.

* These technologies are appropriate for my solution because they provide the investor with a relatively low cost alternative to investments with traditional financial services. They are apropriate a large range of investors and can take the hassle out of actively managing a portfolio.
